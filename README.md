# Step 1: getting start with classic single agent planner

0. Implement `get_neighbours` in `src/source/gridmap.cpp`;

1. Implement `Dijkstra`;

2. Implement `A*`;

# Step 2: running benchmark

# Step 3: implementing space-time `A*` to solve single-agent with dynamic obstacles

# Step 4: using space-time `A*` to solve multi-agent pathfinding problem by `Prioritized Planning`
